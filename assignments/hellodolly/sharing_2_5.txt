Since the child process is a clone of the parent (mother) process, we do actually share some parts. 
For example, we do share:
    - References to open files. 

1. If process A opens a file, a file table entry is created by the OS. 
2. The process is given a reference to this entry
3. This entry referenceis then saved in a file descriptor table owned by the process.
4. Process A is cloned into process B. 
5. Process B will have a copy of the file descriptor table. 
6. Process B will have all references pointing to the same entries in the file table. 

The standard output is nothing more than an entry in the file descriptor table, this is 
why both process can write to it. 

We read from the same standard input, so here's a race condition.
