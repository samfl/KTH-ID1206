The beauty of standard I/O redirection is demonstrated while introducing the concepts of pipes. 
A pipe is simply a FIFO-buffer (First In First Out). 
When a pipe is created, 2 file descriptor entries are allocated (one for reading, one for writing).

Since we are in control over the descriptor table before we start executing a program, we can make 
one prgram send all its output to another program input. 
From the shell, this is very powerful. 

Example: 

    1. ps axo sid (print the session identifier)
    2. sort -u (sort lines and output only unique)
    3. wc -l (count number of lines)

    Can these be combined to find the number of sessions in the system?
    
    -> Yes, using the shell and pipes command '|': 

        ps axo sid | sort -u | wc -l


Number of sessins in my system (Lubuntu) was 62.
