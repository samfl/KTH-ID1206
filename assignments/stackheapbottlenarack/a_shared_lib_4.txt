There is a lot of junk in the middle, between the stack and the heap. Some are executable, 
some writable and some are described as similar to: 
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.31.so

All of these segments are allocated for shared libraries, either the code or areas used 
for dynamic data structures.

In this assignment, we have been using library procedures for printing messages, finding
process identifiers and for allocating memory etc. All of these routines are located 
somewhere in these segments.

For example, if we free memory twice (deallocation) things will break since only malloc
procedures keep information about the allocated data structures.
