1. Intro
Implement malloc with a scheme similar to dlmalloc (Doug Lee's malloc).
With help of a general strategy.
- Be familiar with the role of the allocator
- Implement a simple version
- Benchmark a simple version

2. The Implementation
Problem: How do we handle the free list? 
- There are strategies with constant time for return and coalesce of blocks
  (Hidden info is kept within blocks.. next, prev, header-size, footer-size)
- Start with one free list
- Create your own implementation

2.1 Setting

2.2 Operations in a block

2.3 Allocate and Free

3. Your first implementation

3.1 Coalescing blocks

3.2 Gain? 

4. Improve performance

4.1 Size of the head

4.2 Order, order, order

4.3 Why only one list

4.4 More arenas

5. Summary
Do some LateX man!
